            <p>The use of FundingBox Meetings requires neither subscription and
                creation of an account nor registration. If
                you connect with FundingBox Meetings through the FundingBox
                Platform, we do not record this. We collect your
                data only in the scope necessary to provide the Service. </p>
            <p>We do not use cookies or any other tracking technology. The list
                of your recent Meetings is stored with a
                browser technology called "local storage" which, unlike cookies,
                collectively never reaches our servers.
            </p>
            <p>We do not use any third-party services that might put cookies in
                your browser. We consider the necessity of
                every piece of data we keep, only retaining what we need to
                identify and troubleshoot problems and to improve
                the Service. Collected data will never be used for any other
                purpose.
            </p>


            <h2>What personal information we process?</h2>
            <p>We aim to protect privacy on our platform by collecting as little
                user data as possible, and encouraging our
                users to use protective technologies as VPNs or privacy-first
                browsers.</p>
            <p>We consider the necessity of every piece of data we keep, only
                retaining what we need to identify and
                troubleshoot problems and to improve the service. Collected data
                will never be used for any other purpose.</p>

            <p>To provide the Service, we process network usage information,
                including IP addresses of the Meeting
                Participants and the URL used to host the Meeting.</p>
            <p>Our servers <strong>temporarily store</strong> this information,
                only our system administrators and developers
                can access it as needed, and it is <strong>permanently deleted
                    after seven (7) days</strong>.</p>


            <p>During a meeting, we also collect Meeting related content, which
                may contain personal information. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>if you use the chat function, chat messages are stored
                    during the Meeting.</li>
                <li>in addition, users have the option to remain anonymous or
                    provide a name and email address that will be
                    displayed to Participants in the Meeting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All this information is temporarily stored on our servers to
                enable user functionality in a video Meeting and
                permanently deleted as soon as the last Participant leaves the
                Meeting. We use Amazon (AWS) infrastructure to
                provide the Service.</p>

            <p>If you use the FundingBox Meetings mobile App, we may request to
                access your device calendar to detect which
                events contain the Meeting link or allow you to add the Meeting
                link to existing events. In this case,
                information from the events in your device remains in your
                device and will never be transmitted to our servers.</p>


            <p>If you email or otherwise contact us, our <strong>customer
                    support</strong> team may also retain information
                you'd
                find in an email, like first and last name and/or email address.
                This data is accessed
                exclusively by customer support and developers as needed, and
                helps us provide support, fix things, and
                generally talk directly to you.</p>


            <h2>How is personal information used?</h2>
            <p>We use this information to provide and improve the FundingBox
                Meetings service. In addition, we may need to use
                this information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
                    enforceable governmental request.</li>
                <li>enforce applicable Terms, including investigation of
                    potential violations.</li>
                <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or
                    technical issues.</li>
                <li>protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of
                    FundingBox, our users, or the public as required
                    or permitted by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By default all Meetings are open, so anyone with the link may
                join. You can change it in your settings.</p>

            <p>You can also lock the Meeting with a password, so only the people
                with the password can join.</p>

            <p>We use the Gmail/Google calendar plugin which allows you to
                attach the Meeting link to Google events directly
                from the google calendar app. We do not store those data.</p>

            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <p>We will update this privacy policy as needed so that it is
                current, accurate, and as clear as possible. Your
                continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our
                updated Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>Terms</h2>
            <p>Please also read our <a href="/static/terms">Terms</a> which also
                governs the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
